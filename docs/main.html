    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering
      Department at the University of Illinois Chicago. I am very fortunate to
      be advised by Prof. <a href="https://hanshuo.people.uic.edu/site/">Shuo Han</a>. I received my bachelors in
      Department of Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/">Southern University of Science
      and Technology</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My primary research interests lie in reinforcement learning and game
      theory. Currently, I am working on combining model-based RL with
      model-free RL. Previously, I have worked on projects that examines
      optimization techniques for Stackelberg games.
